Hello there!

I'm excited to share with you my latest project, which is a Python script that retrieves air quality data from the Transport for London (TFL) API, processes the data, and creates an interactive map to visualize air quality levels in different boroughs of London. As a student, I wanted to showcase my skills in data analysis and visualization by working with a real-time data source, such as the TFL API.

To use the script, you will need to register for an app ID and app key on the TFL website, which you can then use to substitute in the script's headers dictionary. More information on how to register and use the TFL API can be found on the TFL website.

The script uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the TFL API, the pandas library to manipulate the data, and the Folium library to create the interactive map. It runs as a scheduled job every 30 seconds, retrieving the latest air quality data and updating the map accordingly.

The interactive map is designed to show markers for each borough, with the size of the marker indicating the level of air pollution. When clicking on a marker, users can see the name of the borough and the air quality level in micrograms per cubic meter. The map can be zoomed in and out and dragged to explore different areas.

I hope this project showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization, and demonstrates the power of real-time data sources in creating informative and interactive visualizations. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback on the project.
